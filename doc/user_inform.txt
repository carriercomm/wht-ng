THANK YOU!

Dear Web Enthusiast,

Thank you for applying for our affordable web hosting solution!

We will need several things from you in order to start the hosting for your web site:

   1. Please provide us with the information about your web site:
      a) Do you have the domain name registered?
      If it's NOT registered, we can register the domain name for you for $11.25 (yearly fee).
      However, this fee is required only if you want us to register domain name, otherwise,
      NO ADDITIONAL FEE is required.

      If you have registered the domain name already, you will have to change the DNS
      servers information to reflect our hosts' nameservers:
      !!! - here primary and secondary name servers - !!!.
      If you don't know how, please provide us with the information about your domain name
      holder (where you have registered your domain). We will need the URL address, login
      name and password in order to change the DNS information for you. Later, you can
      change your password to maintain the security.
